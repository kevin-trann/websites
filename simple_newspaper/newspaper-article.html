In a stunning shake-up of the world order, Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and sworn enemy of the World Government, has officially been recognized as one of the Four Emperors of the Sea. Following his victory over Kaido of the Beasts on the battlefield of Wano, sources confirm that Luffy now commands immense influence, territory, and a fearsome fleet of allies. Witnesses report seeing Luffy unleash Conqueror’s Haki so powerful it split the sky—an unmistakable sign of his rise to the top. “He’s not just reckless anymore,” said a Grand Fleet ally. “He’s a symbol now.”

Reactions across the seas have been swift and varied. The World Government has declined to comment, though CP0 agents are reportedly on high alert. High-ranking Marines warn this disrupts the global balance of power. Even Emperor Red-Haired Shanks was said to smile and mutter, “It’s about time.” Luffy’s bounty has skyrocketed to 3,000,000,000 Berries, and whispers of “Joy Boy” now echo louder than ever. One thing is clear: the era of Monkey D. Luffy is here.
